Peque - Personal Quest Engine - Architecture
--------------------------------------------

The Environment Object:
-----------------------

Contains two separate objects: the front end and the back end. The front
end has a reference to the back end, but the back end is not aware of the
front end. This is so when the front end goes out of scope it will
destroy the entire environment contained in the backend.

The front end is the user interface. It transfers all requests to the
back end using AUTOLOAD. The environment is responsible for initializing
and managing the various entities in the game:

1. Objects - collectable and static.
2. Rooms.
3. Characters
4. Callbacks
5. Methods
6. Others... ?

IDs
---

Each entity has a unique ID. The environment collects all the IDs of the 
entities in a hash whose values are the entities. An entity can be referenced 
by its ID.

Entities:
---------

All entities contain a reference to the environment. they are constructed like
this:

my $carrot = $env->Object(
    'name' => "Carrot",
    'type' => "non-enum",
    'desc' => "This is an orange"
    );

It can later be further initialized using the init method:

$carrot->init(
    'location' => $garden_room,
    ...
);
