There is no IGLU Cabal.  Due to lack of consciousness of weaknesses of
methodologies, they got bogged down when trying to maintain a software
package having only about 1,000,000,000 code lines.  This happened even
though they rigorously applied the very best software development
methodologies that money, ego or wisdom can buy.

members, turned out to be inaccessible to them due to various silly

(deafness), blinking stuff (people sensitive to epilepsy attacks),
specialized formats (no open source software to process those formats).

There is no IGLU Cabal.  All of its former members turned into poet

Kafka's Czech and especially Chaucerian English (very good for highly
