<h1><a href="../">Perl Advent Calendar 2006-12</a>-[[[TODO]]]</h1>
<h2 align="center">"Except that what? No acktthpt that!"</h2>
<h3 align="center">by Shlomi Fish</h3>

<p>
First off, a confession: I spent considerable time today trying to integrate
the subject of this feature with <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a>, and so
decided to write about it here. I was initailly unsuccessful due to a bug in
present in my relatively old version, since fixed on CPAN. That's what you get
for being an "early adopter".
</p>

<p>
Andy 'petdance' Lester recently released the useful command line utility
<tt><a href="http://petdance.com/ack/">ack</a></tt>. It is similar to the
venerable <tt>grep</tt>, and primarily intended for scanning trees of code,
especially such trees that contain code in many different languages.
<tt>ack</tt> command lines  tend to be much shorter than the equivalent
<tt>grep -r</tt> or <tt>find</tt> command lines. <tt>ack</tt>'s only non-core
requirement is Andy's <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/File-Next/">File::Next</a>.
</p>

<span style="color:#06c; font-weight: bold">#Maybe include some text about File::Next? Or perhaps a brief mention of FFO which should then preceed the publication of this.</span>

<h2>Let's start... searching!</h2>

<p>
Our corpus for this example is the 
<a href="http://www.parrotcode.org/">parrot source tree</a>, which is about as
heterogenous as a source tree as you can get. For the terminally curious: we
grabbed a copy from the subversion repository, and then installed ack from
CPAN in the customary manner like so:
</p>

<pre>
$ svn co -r 15920 http://svn.perl.org/parrot/trunk
<span class="c">#Command output omitted.</span>
$ perl -MCPAN -e "install App::Ack"
<span class="c">#Command output omitted.</span>
</pre>

<p>
Now we can <tt>cd</tt> into the parrot trunk and start playing with it.

<pre>
$ ack 'fprintf.*Bad expr' .<span class="c">
languages/m4/src/eval.c
291:      fprintf( stderr, "Bad expression in eval (missing right parenthesis): %s",
296:      fprintf( stderr, "Bad expression in eval: %s", expr);
300:      fprintf( stderr, "Bad expression in eval (bad input): %s", expr);
304:      fprintf( stderr, "Bad expression in eval (excess input): %s", expr);</span>
</pre>

<p>
<tt>ack</tt> accepts a perl regular expression as its first argument. The other
arguments are path names. We specified "." (the current directory) and as we 
can see <tt>ack</tt> proceeded to recurse the branch, which it does by default.
The first thing you probably notice is that the user-friendly output format. However, it will produce a more machine readable grep-like
<tt>"${filename}:${line_num}:${line}"</tt>  format if its output is piped to
another program:
</p>

<pre>
$ ack 'fprintf.*Bad expr' . | cat<span class="c">
languages/m4/src/eval.c:291:      fprintf( stderr, "Bad expression in eval (missing right parenthesis): %s",
languages/m4/src/eval.c:296:      fprintf( stderr, "Bad expression in eval: %s", expr);
languages/m4/src/eval.c:300:      fprintf( stderr, "Bad expression in eval (bad input): %s", expr);
languages/m4/src/eval.c:304:      fprintf( stderr, "Bad expression in eval (excess input): %s", expr);</span>
</pre>

<p>
This allows it to be used as a drop-in replacement  for grep in text editors
and other tools. Something else you might notice is that despite the fact that
it operated on a Subversion working copy, it didn't display results from the
copies of the files inside the <tt>.svn</tt> directories. This is more than we
can say for a simple <tt>grep -r</tt>:
</p>

<pre>
$ grep -rn 'fprintf.*Bad expr' .<span class="c">
./languages/m4/src/.svn/text-base/eval.c.svn-base:291:      fprintf( stderr, "Bad expression in eval (missing right parenthesis): %s",
./languages/m4/src/.svn/text-base/eval.c.svn-base:296:      fprintf( stderr, "Bad expression in eval: %s", expr);
./languages/m4/src/.svn/text-base/eval.c.svn-base:300:      fprintf( stderr, "Bad expression in eval (bad input): %s", expr);
./languages/m4/src/.svn/text-base/eval.c.svn-base:304:      fprintf( stderr, "Bad expression in eval (excess input): %s", expr);
./languages/m4/src/eval.c:291:      fprintf( stderr, "Bad expression in eval (missing right parenthesis): %s",
./languages/m4/src/eval.c:296:      fprintf( stderr, "Bad expression in eval: %s", expr);
./languages/m4/src/eval.c:300:      fprintf( stderr, "Bad expression in eval (bad input): %s", expr);
./languages/m4/src/eval.c:304:      fprintf( stderr, "Bad expression in eval (excess input): %s", expr);</span>
</pre>

<p>
(Expecting trouble? Make it <b>double!</b>.)
<span style="color:#06c; font-weight: bold">#What the heck is this?</span>
</p>

<p>
<tt>ack</tt> does not descend into such directories as <tt>.svn</tt>,
<tt>blib</tt>, <tt>CVS</tt>, because they obscure the results.
</p>

<span style="color:#06c; font-weight: bold">#Removed duplicated example, left expanded explanation</span>

<h2>Perl Regexps</h2>

<p>
Since it's written in perl, <tt>ack</tt> makes use of perl regular expressions.
So for example we can say:
</p>

<pre>$ ack '\b\$pattern\s*' .</pre>

<p>
This is much more convenient and less confusing than the myriad flavors
of <tt>grep</tt> out there, including those with PCRE syntax which is not
fully compatible with perl's regular expressions.
<span style="color:#06c; font-weight: bold">#Since when?</span>
As an aside, note that PCRE support is not even available in
<a href="https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/grep/+bug/15051">
all modern builds</a> of GNU grep.
</p>

<h2>Filetype Identification</h2>

<p>
<tt>ack</tt> has options to search specific file types.
For example we can say:
</p>

<pre>
$ ack --perl fprintf .<span class="c">
tools/build/pbc2c.pl
266:            fprintf(stderr, "\t" INTVAL_FMT ": %s\n", i, argv[i]);

tools/dev/lib_deps.pl
410:fprintf     stdio.h
619:vfprintf    stdio.h</span>
</pre>

<p>
To look for occurences of "fprintf" in Perl files. Note that <tt>--perl</tt>
will search several popular extensions for Perl files, but also files whose
shebang-lines point to perl. We can even specify more than one file type,
or there longopt <tt>--no$lang</tt> counterpart.
</p>

<h2>What's Next?</h2>
<span style="color:#06c; font-weight: bold">#Bad section name</span>

<p>
<tt>ack</tt> has <a href="http://use.perl.org/~petdance/journal/31763">many
other nifty features</a>, but is still under development and
<a href="http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=ack">has some 
bugs</a>.

<span style="color:#06c; font-weight: bold">#Is Andy actually looking for developers?</span>

So you can join the fun if you're interested to develop it.
Until then, you can still use it as is for your enjoyment and convenience.
