<h1><a href="../">Perl Advent Calendar 2006-12</a>-[[[TODO]]]</h1>
<h2 align="center">"Except that what? No acktthpt that!"</h2>
<h3 align="center">by Shlomi Fish</h3>

<p>
First of all a confession: I spent some time today trying to run the subject
of this feature from within <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a>, and so
decided to write about it here. The reason I was not successful for a long
time was because of a bug in it that was present in my relatively old version,
and was fixed since in the CPAN version, so make sure you use the latest
version too. (Or else - no help for you.)
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://petdance.com/ack/">ack</a> is a useful command line utility
for searching text, primarily intended for scanning trees of code, especially
such trees that contain code in many different languages. ack command lines 
tend to be much shorter than the equivalent <tt>grep -r</tt> or <tt>find</tt>
command lines. ack is written in perl and except for the perl core, requires
only the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/File-Next/">File::Next</a> 
module from the CPAN.
</p>

<h2>Let's start... searching!</h2>

<p>
Our corpus for this example would be the 
<a href="http://www.parrotcode.org/">parrot source tree</a> which is as
heterogenous a source tree as they can get. Use the following command to
checkout it from its subversion repository:
</p>

<pre>
svn co -r 15920 http://svn.perl.org/parrot/trunk
</pre>

<p>
(We're specifying a particular revision so we'll get predictable results).
</p>

<p>
Now lets' install ack from the CPAN: <tt>perl -MCPAN -e "install
App::Ack"</tt>. Like I said, make sure you're using the latest version.
</p>

<p>
Now we can cd into the parrot trunk and start playing with it.

<pre>
$ ack 'fprintf.*Bad expr' .
languages/m4/src/eval.c
291:      fprintf( stderr, "Bad expression in eval (missing right parenthesis): %s",
296:      fprintf( stderr, "Bad expression in eval: %s", expr);
300:      fprintf( stderr, "Bad expression in eval (bad input): %s", expr);
304:      fprintf( stderr, "Bad expression in eval (excess input): %s", expr);
</pre>

<p>
ack accepts a perl regular expression as its first argument. The other
arguments are path names. We specified "." (the current directory) and as we 
can see ack recursed into it, which it does by default. The first thing we 
notice is that its output is in a userfriendly format. However it will use
a more machine readable grep-like <tt>"${filename}:${line_num}:${line}"</tt> 
format if it is piped to a program:
</p>

<pre>
$ ack 'fprintf.*Bad expr' . | cat
languages/m4/src/eval.c:291:      fprintf( stderr, "Bad expression in eval (missing right parenthesis): %s",
languages/m4/src/eval.c:296:      fprintf( stderr, "Bad expression in eval: %s", expr);
languages/m4/src/eval.c:300:      fprintf( stderr, "Bad expression in eval (bad input): %s", expr);
languages/m4/src/eval.c:304:      fprintf( stderr, "Bad expression in eval (excess input): %s", expr);
</pre>

<p>
This allows it to be used as a droppable grep-replacement by editors and other
tools. The other thing we notice is that despite the fact that it operated on a
Subversion working copy, it didn't display results from the copies of the
files inside the <tt>.svn</tt> directories. This is more than we can say
for <tt>grep -r</tt>:
</p>

<pre>
$ grep -rn 'fprintf.*Bad expr' .
./languages/m4/src/.svn/text-base/eval.c.svn-base:291:      fprintf( stderr, "Bad expression in eval (missing right parenthesis): %s",
./languages/m4/src/.svn/text-base/eval.c.svn-base:296:      fprintf( stderr, "Bad expression in eval: %s", expr);
./languages/m4/src/.svn/text-base/eval.c.svn-base:300:      fprintf( stderr, "Bad expression in eval (bad input): %s", expr);
./languages/m4/src/.svn/text-base/eval.c.svn-base:304:      fprintf( stderr, "Bad expression in eval (excess input): %s", expr);
./languages/m4/src/eval.c:291:      fprintf( stderr, "Bad expression in eval (missing right parenthesis): %s",
./languages/m4/src/eval.c:296:      fprintf( stderr, "Bad expression in eval: %s", expr);
./languages/m4/src/eval.c:300:      fprintf( stderr, "Bad expression in eval (bad input): %s", expr);
./languages/m4/src/eval.c:304:      fprintf( stderr, "Bad expression in eval (excess input): %s", expr);
</pre>

<p>
(Expecting trouble? Make it <b>double!</b>.)
</p>

<p>
ack does not descend into such directories as <tt>.svn</tt>, <tt>blib</tt>,
<tt>CVS</tt>, because they obscure the results. Now try acheiving the same
effect with grep:
</p>

<pre>
grep -n 'fprintf.*Bad expr' $(find . -type f | grep -v \\.svn)
</pre>

<p>
Much less civil! But wait there's more...
</p>

<h2>Perl Regexps</h2>

<p>
Since it's written in perl, ack makes use of perl regular expressions. So for
example we can say:
</p>

<pre>
$ ack '\b\$pattern\s*' .
</pre>

<p>
This is much more convenient and less confusing than the miriad of syntaxes
of grep out there, as well as the PCRE syntax, which is not fully compatible
with perl's regular expressions, and 
<a href="https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/grep/+bug/15051">is 
not available in all builds of GNU grep</a>.
</p>

<h2>Filetype Identification</h2>

<p>
ack has several options to search in specific file types. For example we can 
use:
</p>

<pre>
$ ack --perl fprintf .
tools/build/pbc2c.pl
266:            fprintf(stderr, "\t" INTVAL_FMT ": %s\n", i, argv[i]);

tools/dev/lib_deps.pl
410:fprintf     stdio.h
619:vfprintf    stdio.h
</pre>

<p>
To look for occurences of "fprintf" in Perl files. Note that <tt>--perl</tt>
will search several popular extensions for Perl files, but also files whose
shabang-lines are appropriate to perl. We can specify more than one file type
</p>

<pre>
$ ack --ruby --python 'print' .
</pre>

<p>
And there are also the equivalent <tt>--no$lang</tt> flags.
</p>

<h2>What's Next?</h2>

<p>
ack has <a href="http://use.perl.org/~petdance/journal/31763">many
other nifty features</a>. It's also still under development and 
<a href="http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=ack">has some 
bugs</a>. So you can join the fun if you're interested to develop it.
Until then, you can still use it as is for your enjoyment and convenience.
