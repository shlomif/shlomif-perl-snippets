<h2>Integration with Editors</h2>

<h3>Integrating ack with Vim</h3>

<p>
A naive way to see ack results in vim's quickfix buffer would be to use the
<a href="http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/quickfix.html#:cexpr">cexpr
command</a>:
</p>

<pre>
:cexpr system('ack --perl map .')
</pre>

This can be abbreviated to:

<pre>
:cex system('ack --perl map .')
</pre>

<p>
An alternative way would be to set the
<a href="http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/quickfix.html#:grep">:grep
command</a> to use ack instead of grep:
</p>

<pre>
:set grepprg=ack
</pre>

<p>
Then one can write <tt>:grep [ack arguments]</tt> to search using ack. However
this will not allow using grep with this command, so it's not such a good idea.
</p>

<p>
One can create a better solution by adding the following lines to his or her
.vimrc file:
</p>

<pre>
function! Ack_Search(command)
    cexpr system("ack " . a:command)
endfunction

command! -nargs=+ -complete=file Ack call Ack_Search(<q-args>)
</pre>

<p>
This snippet defines a new Ex command called ":Ack" that searches using ack
and displays the results. Then one can say:
</p>

<pre>
:Ack --perl map .
</pre>

<p>
Success!
</p>

<h3>Integrating ack with Emacs</h3>

<p>
In order to integrate ack with XEmacs, one can put <a href="emacs-ack.el">the
    following code</a> in his or her ~/.xemacs/custom.el file.
</p

<p>
Then one can say "M-x ack" to invoke an ack command line. This code was only
tested in XEmacs and may require some adaptation for GNU Emacs.
