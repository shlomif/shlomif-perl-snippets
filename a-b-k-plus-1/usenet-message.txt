Let's examine the series f[k] = a*(b**k)+1 where a and b are positive integers,
and ** is power. Can one show that for some values of a and b, the series will
contain an infinite number of primes? (i.e: for every N there exists a k0 > N,
so that f[k0] is prime.)

From my superficial attempts, I found out that some series like that will never
have primes. Like f[k] = 3**k+1, because 3**k is odd and together they form
an even number. But what about other values of a and b?

And what can be said about f[k] = a*(b**k)-1, with a minus instead of a plus
sign?
